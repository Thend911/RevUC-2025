<h1>COMMIT - An app to motivate students</h1>

<h3> Description: </h3>
<p>As students, we understand and relate to the struggle of being disciplined and attending class every day. To address this, we create a solution, COMMIT, to motivate students to attend classes. By collecting data from your Canvas, we set up personalized reminders and alarms according to your schedule, courses, grades, and preferences to give you a solid reason to be at school! There is also a score system and streaks to keep track of your school activities.</p>
